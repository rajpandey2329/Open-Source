# Analog Layout Automation with Python

This repository provides tools and scripts for generating analog layouts using Python, with a focus on an efficient and scalable workflow in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The project is designed to simplify the creation and customization of analog circuit layouts through programmatic approaches.

---

## Overview
Analog layout design traditionally requires manual efforts that are time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate analog layout generation using Python, leveraging libraries and techniques that enhance productivity and ensure precision. By integrating with VS Code, we provide a streamlined development environment for layout scripting and debugging.

Key features include:

- **Python-Based Layout Generation:** Generate analog layouts programmatically using Python libraries.
- **Customizable Templates:** Build reusable and adaptable layout templates for common analog circuit components.
- **VS Code Integration:** Use VS Code as the primary development environment with support for syntax highlighting, debugging, and version control.
- **Seamless Integration with EDA Tools:** Export layouts to standard formats (e.g., GDSII) compatible with popular EDA tools.

---

## Features
- **Parametric Design:** Create parameterized layouts to adapt to varying design specifications.
- **Efficient Debugging:** Utilize VS Code debugging tools to identify and resolve layout issues.
- **Scalability:** Handle both simple and complex designs through modular code organization.
- **Open-Source Libraries:** Integrate with libraries like KLayout, PyEDA, or custom Python packages for analog layout automation.

## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Visual Studio Code** with Python extension
3. **Additional Libraries:**
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - gdspy (for GDSII file generation)
   - klayout.db (optional for integration with KLayout)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajpandey2329/Open-Source.git
   cd analog-layout-generator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Configure your workspace settings in VS Code for Python development. Ensure dependencies are installed.

2. **Create Layouts:**
   Use the provided template scripts in the `scripts/` directory to start generating your layouts. Customize the parameters in the Python scripts as needed.

3. **Export Layouts:**
   Run the scripts to generate layouts and export them as GDSII files for further processing in EDA tools.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python scripts/example_layout.py
   ```

4. **Visualize Layouts:**
   Use integrated visualization tools or export the layout to a supported viewer.
